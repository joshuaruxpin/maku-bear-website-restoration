work in progress restoration and translation of momcoo.com (maku.com?) 

currently viewable at https://joshiruxpin.neocities.org/maku%20restoration/

credit to the WayBack Machine for archiving as much of this site as possible and making this project possible! (even if there are missing pages :/)


to do:

1# Fully translate all pages

2# Fix broken pages (focus topics, buy maku and homepage)

3# Remove leftover WayBack Machine stuff

4# Remake or somehow recover missing pages

5# fix broken links (where possible)
